Database
========
All information is stored in a sqlite database. The Python-based Flask web
framework is used to provide the HTTP API and the webapp.

The SQL table setup is available in filedb.sql.

To avoid SQL injection, use ? in query strings and pass the arguments instead
of using Python string interpolation.

API
===
It is not possible to modify files from within the file collection. Only the
database file is modified when modifying file meta-data.

Webapp
======
The webapp is a set of dynamic HTML pages with Javascript code that uses the
API to get and modify FileDB data.

The categorize page fetches all files, which is a bit slow, and then does the
searches within the fetched data. The browse page instead uses the API search
functionality.
